Added loading animation to show the system status of all the graph pages.

Tried making it asthetically pleasing by:
  having clear margins.
  adding a simple and clean pattern to background.
  
Show what page you're on through the nav bar.

Color code the buttons on the home page that takes you to the account page.
  Also color coded the nav bar.
  
Limited # of icons for clarity.
